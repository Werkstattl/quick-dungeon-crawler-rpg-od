## Quick Dungeon Crawler on Demand: How It Works

This browser-based game downloads sounds and images only when first needed, then caches them for future use. This saves data but may cause brief delays with new elements. After that, everything loads instantly. The Google Play version isnâ€™t affected. Thanks for playing!
